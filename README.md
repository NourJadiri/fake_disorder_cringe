### Abstract
Since 2018, awareness of mental health issues like ADHD has grown, influenced by social media trends on platforms like TikTok. This project will explore whether rising diagnosis rates align with increased social media discussions or if social media is reacting to these rates. Additionally, we will investigate the demographics of those medically diagnosed and self-diagnosed.

A major focus is to compare the rates of self-diagnosis with formal diagnoses. Geospatial mapping will help identify regions with higher diagnosis rates, potentially revealing trends and social factors affecting these patterns.
## Datasets Description 

The datasets for this project include:

* Public records of ADHD diagnoses for children and adults from the U.S. Department of Health.
* Social media posts from Reddit, TikTok, and Instagram related to ADHD.
* Trends in Google search queries related to ADHD topics.

## Queries 
### Assessing the Population Diagnosed with ADHD in Comparison with Social Media Mentions to Underline a Potential Link
*Objective:* To explore the potential correlation between formal ADHD diagnoses and the frequency of ADHD mentions on social media platforms.

Questions:
1. Annual Comparison:

- How does the total number of ADHD diagnoses each year compare to the total number of ADHD-related mentions on social media platforms during the same period?
    
    _Is there a noticeable trend or correlation between the two over time?_

2. Geographical Analysis:

- How do the numbers of ADHD diagnoses and ADHD-related social media mentions vary across different regions or countries?

    _Are regions with higher rates of ADHD diagnoses also showing higher levels of social media activity related to ADHD?_

3. Demographic Breakdown:

- What are the demographic profiles (age groups and gender) of individuals diagnosed with ADHD compared to those frequently discussing ADHD on social media?
    
    _Do certain demographics show a stronger correlation between diagnosis rates and social media mentions?_

4. Monthly Trends and Spikes:

- Are there specific months or seasons where spikes in ADHD diagnoses align with increased mentions of ADHD on social media platforms?
    
    _Could external factors (like awareness campaigns or events) be influencing these spikes?_

### Understanding the Trend of #self-diagnosis and #self-medication in the ADHD Context on Social Media
*Objective:* To analyze the prevalence and growth of the hashtags #self-diagnosis and #self-medication related to ADHD on social media platforms, and understand their implications.

Questions:

1. Trend Over Time:

- How has the number of social media posts containing the hashtags #self-diagnosis and #self-medication in the context of ADHD changed over time (e.g., monthly or yearly)?
    
    _Is there a significant increase or decrease in these mentions, and what might be influencing these trends?_

2. Proportion of Total Mentions:

- What percentage of all ADHD-related social media posts include references to self-diagnosis or self-medication?
    
    _How has this proportion evolved over time, and what does it suggest about changing attitudes or behaviors?_

3. Geographic Distribution:

- Which regions or countries have the highest number of social media mentions of #self-diagnosis and #self-medication related to ADHD?
    
    _Are there cultural, societal, or healthcare factors that might explain regional differences?_

4. Comparison with Professional Diagnoses Mentions:

- How do the trends in mentions of self-diagnosis compare to mentions of professional diagnoses on social media platforms?
    
    _Is there a shift in how people are discussing their ADHD diagnoses, and what might this indicate about trust in medical professionals or access to healthcare?_
