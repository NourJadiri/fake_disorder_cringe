First, cut off the top of the soda bottle and remove the label. Then, blow up the balloon and tie it to the neck of the bottle. Next, tape the balloon to the bottom of the bottle. Finally, add water to the bottle until it is about half full. When you are ready to launch your rocket, simply release the balloon and watch it fly!\\n\\n'"

Instead, she called me a \"drug addict because I am asking for more pills.\" When I mentioned my history of daily use without tolerance issues, she replied, \"I can only treat based on professional data.\" She ended by saying, \"I won't be prescribing controls of any type until I receive proof that you completed a substance abuse program.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not a drug addict! I have ADHD and need these meds to function. Why are doctors focused on treating the average person instead of the individual? Just because 85% of people build tolerance to stimulants doesn't mean the 15% who don't should be treated the same way.\n",
