First, cut off the top of the soda bottle and remove the label. Then, blow up the balloon and tie it to the neck of the bottle. Next, tape the balloon to the bottom of the bottle. Finally, add water to the bottle until it is about half full. When you are ready to launch your rocket, simply release the balloon and watch it fly!\\n\\n'"
